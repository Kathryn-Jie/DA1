Forecasting methods

Check accurancy
```{r}

Best method: Damped Holt's Linear

ETS better than Damped Holt's Linear

Objective 2:To study the relationship between High Blood Pressure and Obesity
Objective 3:To study the relationship between High Blood Pressure and Low Physical Activity

Scatterplot
```{r}
ggplot(data1, aes(x=HighBloodPressure, y=Obesity)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + ggtitle("Scatterplot of number of deaths caused by High Blood Pressure and Obesity in Malaysia from 1990 to 2017") 
ggplot(data1, aes(x=HighBloodPressure, y=LowPhysicalActivity)) + geom_point() + geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) + ggtitle("Scatterplot of number of deaths caused by High Blood Pressure and Low Physical Activity in Malaysia from 1990 to 2017")
```

Correlation
```{r}
cor(mydata[,3:5])
```
HBP~Obesity 0.9970044, HBP~LPA 0.9887101

Linear Model
```{r}
modelA <- lm(HighBloodPressure ~ Obesity, mydata)
modelB <- lm(HighBloodPressure ~ LowPhysicalActivity, mydata)
```

ANOVA
```{r}
anova(modelA)
anova(modelB)
```
Modify : Reject H0. mean different
Based on the very small p-value, the results indicate that there is evidence to support the hypothesis that the mean numbers of deaths caused by high blood pressure are different for at least one combination of risk factors. Obesity and low physical activity are significant in the case of deaths caused by high blood pressure. 

Multiple Linear Regression
```{r}
modelC <- lm(HighBloodPressure~ Obesity + LowPhysicalActivity , mydata)
summary(modelC)
```
p-value is smaller, so obesity  has a significant effect on number of death caused by high blood pressure. Low physical activity does not seem to have significant effect when the number of death is blocked by obesity.

```{r}
par(mfrow = c(2,2))
plot(modelC)
```

```{r}
resC <- residuals(modelC)
Box.test(resC,lag=10, fitdf=0, type="Lj")
shapiro.test(resC)
checkresiduals(modelC)
```
The model appears to be fairly well fit, though our evidence indicates the score may not be from a normally distributed population. Looking at the Q-Q plot, we can see that towards the higher end, the points are not on the line, so we may not be dealing with normality here.
